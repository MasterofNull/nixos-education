                            It is time to look at OSINT in a different way. For many years, and within the previous editions of this book, we have relied on external resources to supply our search tools, virtual environments, and investigation techniques. We have seen this protocol fail us when services shut down, websites disappear, and custom resources are dismantled due to outside pressures. This book aims to correct our dilemma. We will take control of our investigative resources and become self-reliant. There will be no more need for online search tools; we will make and host our own locally. We will no longer seek pre-built virtual machines; we will create and configure our own. The new OSINT professional must be self-sustaining and possess their own tools and resources. You will become a more proficient subject matter expert who will be armed with the knowledge and readiness to articulate the sources of your findings.<br><br>

                            This new ninth edition contains hundreds of pages which have been updated to keep your OSINT investigative methods fresh. It includes new online and offline search tools; a new Linux OSINT virtual machine; and tutorials to replicate all Linux OSINT tools within Mac and Windows operating systems. Brand-new search methods for Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, YouTube, and others ensure you have the latest techniques within your online investigation arsenal. An entire section is devoted to Methodology, Workflow, Documentation, and Ethics which provides a clear game plan for your next active investigation. All digital files are included via download. Today, we start over.

                            <p class="card-text">If you have the 8th edition of this book, you may want to know what has changed in this 9th edition. The previous edition of this book was originally written in late 2020. Soon after publication, I declared that I was taking a break from writing, which I did. In late 2021, I was asked to update this book, as it is required reading for numerous college courses, university degrees, and government training academies. I never want stale or inaccurate information being presented within training programs, so I created a special hardcover revision for these audiences. I then replicated the content within a more affordable paperback version. In the previous editions, I only published a new version once I had at least 30% new material and 30% updated content. The recycled material was kept to a maximum of 40%. With this edition, I have deviated away from that rule. I estimate that only 20% of the content here is changed, with the remaining 80% recycled from the previous edition. Much of the eighth edition content was still applicable and only needed minor updates to reflect changes since 2020. If you have read the previous edition, you will find most of those overall strategies within this book. However, I have added many new OSINT methods which complement the original text in order to cater to those who always need accurate information. I also removed a lot of outdated content which was no longer applicable. I believe there is much new value within this updated text. The majority of the updates are available in chapters 3, 4, 5, 6, 27, and 28, along with the digital files which accompany them. The other chapters all have minor updates. <br><br>

                            All purchases include free download of updated custom search tools; updated Linux, Mac, and Windows OSINT scripts to build your own virtual machines; detailed cheat-sheets to simplify each process; and a single Linux command to build a complete 2022 OSINT VM with every tool in the entire book. <b>You can find your custom login link and credentials  within chapters 3, 4, 5, and 6 of each book which provides permanent online access to all files.</b> The outline is below.<br /><br />
